# Learning Azure

## Hands-on workshops

To help get you started, we created three separate workshops. These workshops contain hands on exercises, to help get you up and running with common technologies and scenarios.

- [Web and Artificial Intelligence](./web-ai-mood-dectector): Azure provides powerful AI tools, wrapped up in APIs that you can use from your apps to add intelligence without being an AI expert. In this hands-on workshop you will build a [Python](https://python.org) app that takes advantage of one of these APIs to detect emotions in faces, alerting you if you have a sad face too often. This app will be in two parts, one part that runs on the desktop and takes photos, and another that runs in the cloud to analyse photos and store the emotions detected. You can [see Jim walk you through the Web and AI workshop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Cg2MlVByJQ&feature=youtu.be).
- [Machine Learning](./ml-endangered-animal-detector/): In this workshop you will create a cloud application that will help detect endangered animals in the wild. Being able to analyse the contents of images and act on the information is a great intelligent feature than can enhance your application. You can [see Amy walk you through the ML workshop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iR07ZShptyI&feature=youtu.be)
- [Spatial Computing and Mixed Reality](./spatial-babylonjs): In this workshop we will go over the basic languages that make up a static website (HTML, JavaScript and CSS). From here we will dive into building a simple WebVR game with the JavaScript framework [Babylon.js](https://www.babylonjs.com/). After the step-by-step workshop to build the game we will learn about Azure Cloud and how to host your WebVR game. By pushing your site up to Azure Cloud you will be able to share your game with all your friends!
